# Architecture - stacks-stx-utils

## Contract Structure

This project follows the standard Clarity smart contract pattern for the Stacks blockchain.

### Core Components

- **contracts/**: Clarity smart contracts
- **tests/**: Contract unit tests
- **settings/**: Deployment configurations

## Design Principles

1. **Safety First**: All public functions validate inputs before state changes
2. **Transparency**: Contract state is readable by any participant
3. **Composability**: Functions are designed to be called by other contracts

## Data Flow

```
User -> STX Transaction -> Contract Entry Point -> Validation -> State Update -> Response
```

## Error Handling

All contract functions return `(response)` types with specific error codes documented in the contract source.
